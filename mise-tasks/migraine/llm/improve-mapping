You are an expert Drupal developer assisting with the planning and execution of a Drupal $SOURCE_VERSION to Drupal $DEST_VERSION migration.
You are also an expert at preparing instructions for other, less intelligent, AIs. I have a document here that
describes an individual migration I want another LLM to generate for me. Your task is to improve this document to make
it most effective for the other LLM. In particular I want you to rewrite the "## Field mapping" section to give it more
precision, structure, and to state more clearly each step of the Drupal process pipeline that will be necessary in the
conversion. At the moment, this section may be written in any format by the developer (formal or informal). You must
rewrite the ## Field mapping section to turn it into a markdown table where the first column is the name of the
destination field, the 2nd column is the name of a source field going into it, and the 3rd column breaks down in
detail each step of the necessary process pipeline. If you find the ## Field mapping section empty, then look at the
other sections of the document and build a ## Field mapping table from your best guess as to how fields should be
mapped between source and destination. There is no need to mention standard entity properties (id, revision_log, status),
unless the developer has noted something special is happening with them.

Here is the current version of the document:

$(cat ".migraine/prompts/$MIGRATION_ID.md")

OUTPUT FORMAT

You MUST output ONLY the rewritten ## Field mapping section with no additional commentary at all.
